# Intervals

## Explanation

Interval problems involve a set of intervals and often require operations like merging overlapping intervals, inserting new intervals, or finding non-overlapping intervals. They can be approached by sorting the intervals based on starting or ending points and then iterating through the sorted list to find the solution.

## Example Problems

- **Merge Intervals:** Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
- **Non-overlapping Intervals:** Find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Time Complexity

- The initial sort operation typically dictates the overall time complexity, making it O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.
- The subsequent iteration to merge or process intervals is O(n).

## Space Complexity

- Space complexity is often O(n) to store the output array of intervals.

## Implementation

```python
# Python implementation for Merging Intervals

def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    # Sort intervals based on the start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        prev = merged[-1]
        
        # If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval, merge them
        if current[0] <= prev[1]:
            merged[-1] = (prev[0], max(prev[1
