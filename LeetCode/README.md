# Algorithm Categories and Techniques

This repository contains explanations, Python implementations, and complexity analyses of various algorithmic topics and techniques. Each directory corresponds to a specific category or technique and includes a Python file with the implementation and a Markdown file with the explanation and complexity analysis.

## Contents

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Sliding Window
- Linked List
- Trees
- Tries
- Backtracking
- Graphs
- Heap / Priority Queue
- Intervals
- Greedy
- Advanced Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (1-D DP, 2-D DP)
- Bit Manipulation
- Math & Geometry

Each category covers fundamental concepts, example problems, and solutions along with time and space complexity analysis.

## How to Use

You can browse through the repository to find specific algorithm implementations and explanations. Each folder contains:

- A Python file (`.py`) with the algorithm implementation.
- A Markdown file (`.md`) detailing the explanation, example usage, and complexity analysis.

## Contributions
