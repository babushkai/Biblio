"""This program uses the requests module to make API calls to an online service that provides stock prices. It then checks if the stock price for a particular company (in this case, Google) has increased since the previous day's close, and if it has, it uses the API to buy shares of the stock. Of course, this is just an example, and there are many other ways to write a Python program that could potentially make money. The specific details and requirements would depend on the specific context and circumstances."""
