# "This program uses the API endpoint and parameters to retrieve the latest listing information for Ethereum, and then parses the response to extract the current price in US dollars. The program then prints the price to the console. This is just an example, and there are many other ways to write a Python program to retrieve the price of Ethereum using the CoinMarketCap API or other data sources."
