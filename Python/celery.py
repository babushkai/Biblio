#In this example, the my_task function is defined as a Celery task by decorating it with the `@app.

from celery import Celery

app = Celery()

@app.task
def my_task(arg1, arg2):
    # Perform some time-consuming or resource-intensive operation here
    pass

# Schedule the task to run in 10 seconds
my_task.apply_async(args=["arg1", "arg2"], countdown=10)


"""Celery is a task queueing system that is commonly used for scheduling and executing background tasks in a distributed environment. It allows you to define and schedule tasks, and distribute them across multiple worker processes for execution. This can be useful for tasks that are time-consuming or resource-intensive, and that can be run independently of the main application.

When using Celery, tasks are defined as Python functions or callables. These tasks can be scheduled to run at a specific time or on a regular schedule, and can be executed by one or more worker processes. To schedule a task in Celery, you will need to use the apply_async method and provide the necessary arguments and settings. Here is an example of how to schedule a task in Celery:
