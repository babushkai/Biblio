#n this example, the reduce function is called with a lambda function and the numbers list as arguments. The lambda function takes two numbers x and y as arguments and returns their sum. The reduce function applies this function to each pair of numbers in the numbers list, starting with the first two numbers and then proceeding with the result of each previous step and the next number in the list. In this case, the reduce function returns the value 15, which is the sum of all the numbers in the list.

Overall, the reduce function is a powerful tool for working with sequences of data in Python. It allows you to apply a function to each pair of elements in a sequence and reduce the sequence to a single value, making it easy to perform complex operations on large datasets.

from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)

print(total)  # Prints 15
