Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependency should be on abstractions not concretions
A. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

There comes a point in software development where our app will be largely composed of modules. 
When this happens, we have to clear things up by using dependency injection. 
High-level components depending on low-level components to function.
